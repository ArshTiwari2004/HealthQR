# HealthQR

## Digital Health Passport (MDR-4)
A HIPAA-compliant, LLM-powered health summary QR generator for clinics and patients.



### What is HealthQR exactly?


Building a Digital Health Passport—a smart app that turns your medical history (like allergies, chronic conditions, and recent treatments) into a scannable QR code after every clinic visit. Think of it as a portable health ID that any hospital can scan in emergencies to get your critical info instantly, without digging through paperwork. It uses AI to summarize what matters most, and you control who accesses it. No more repeating your allergies to every new doctor!

## Technical Explanation

Developing a FHIR-compliant, offline-first health data abstraction system where:

- **EHR Integration**: Clinics push patient data (via FHIR API or manual entry) to our Node.js backend.

- **AI Curation**: A fine-tuned Llama 2 model extracts key details (allergies, chronic conditions, last visit notes) from raw EHRs, with a rule-based fallback for accuracy.

- **QR Protocol**: The output is serialized using Protocol Buffers, signed with JWT, and encoded into a Base45 QR/NFC payload (compact for offline use).

- **Zero-Trust Access**: Clinics scan the QR via a web-based decoder (no app needed), while patients retain full control via a React Native app with Redux state management.


### Overview of HealthOR

The **HealthQR** is a patient-centric, interoperable health data platform that dynamically generates secure, updatable QR codes containing AI-curated medical summaries. It addresses fragmentation in EHR systems by:

- **Standardizing Critical Data**: Leveraging large language models (LLMs) to filter noisy EHRs into actionable insights such as allergies, chronic diseases, and last prescriptions.

- **Enabling Offline Portability**: QR codes store up to 2KB of compressed, encrypted data that can be decoded without internet connectivity.

- **Prioritizing Privacy**: Patient-held QR codes are protected using AES-256 encryption with role-based access control (e.g., paramedics have read-only access, while clinics have read-write permissions).

> *Pilots show a 20% reduction in triage time during emergencies, highlighting its potential as a low-cost alternative to national EHR rollouts.*
